# Credit Card Default Prediction

I created a Credit Card Default Predictor for FAIR-AI, under Enigma, the Machine Learning Event of CodeFest at IIT(BHU) Varanasi CSE Department Festival. Using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques, I applied data preprocessing steps and employed SMOTE to address gender imbalance in the dataset, ensuring fairness in model predictions. I utilized CatBoost for modeling and conducted efficient hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, achieving rapid optimization.

# Results

The best performing model was able to secure a best score of 0.52595(out of 1), where the evaluation metric was a combination of the F1 Score and the Demographic Parity Ratio.
